   <h2>Do you know shekla-tibs?</h2>
    <p>Shekla Tibs is a traditional Ethiopian dish featuring sautéed meat, typically beef or lamb, infused with aromatic spices and herbs. The term "Shekla" refers to the clay pot in which the dish is traditionally served, keeping the contents warm and enhancing the communal dining experience. The meat is often cooked with onions, garlic, rosemary, and spicy berbere seasoning, resulting in a flavorful and hearty meal. Shekla Tibs is commonly enjoyed with injera, a spongy flatbread that complements the rich flavors of the dish.</p>

    <h2>Steps to make good shekla-tibs</h2>  
    <ol>
        <li><b>First step:</b> Gather and prepare all ingredients. Heat a sauté pan over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li><b>Sauté the Onions:</b> Add the sliced onions to the dry pan and cook until the edges char slightly, enhancing their flavor.</li>
        <li><b>Add Fat and Meat:</b> Incorporate the ghee or niter kibbeh into the pan, followed by the beef pieces. Stir-fry quickly over high heat to brown the meat's exterior while keeping the interior tender.</li>
        <li><b>Introduce Spices and Aromatics:</b> Once the meat is browned, add the berbere spice mix, ground fenugreek, cardamom, ground ginger, cumin, ground clove, black pepper, sliced garlic, and green chiles. Stir-fry for about 30 seconds to release the spices' aromas.</li>
        <li><b>Add Tomatoes:</b> Mix in the broken-up peeled tomatoes. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken slightly.</li>
        <li><b>Serve Immediately:</b> Transfer the hot mixture to a shekla (clay pot) to keep it warm, or serve directly onto a plate. Pair with injera or your preferred side.</li>
    </ol>
